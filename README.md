## üìú **Introduction**
A double inverted pendulum consists of two pendulums, where the second pendulum is attached to the end of the first. Each pendulum swings under the influence of gravity, creating a highly unstable and nonlinear system. Due to its intricate dynamics, the double inverted pendulum is widely used as a benchmark problem in:
- **Control Theory**
- **Robotics Research**
- **Physics Instruction**
- **Aerospace Engineering**

### System Description:
- **Masses:** Pendulum 1 and Pendulum 2 have masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), respectively.
- **Lengths:** Their respective lengths are \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \).
- **Angles:** Pendulum 1 forms an angle \( \theta_1 \) with the x-axis, and Pendulum 2 forms \( \theta_2 \) relative to Pendulum 1.

## üìê **Derivation of Dynamics**

### **Kinetic Energy Calculation**
The kinetic energy (\( K \)) is calculated by summing the kinetic energies of the two masses. Using trigonometry to relate angular velocities (\( \dot{\theta}_1 \) and \( \dot{\theta}_2 \)), the total kinetic energy is:

### **Potential Energy Calculation**
The potential energy (\( P \)) is derived as the sum of the potential energies of the two pendulums, relative to their heights:

### **Lagrangian and Equations of Motion**
The Lagrangian (\( L \)) of the system is calculated as the difference between kinetic and potential energy:
\[
L = K - P
\]

Using **Lagrange's Equations**, the equations of motion for the double inverted pendulum are derived as follows:
